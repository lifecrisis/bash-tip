# bash-tip


## Introduction

The `tip` script provided here is inspired by the [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat)
project.  If you've never used `cheat`, I encourage you to try it.

This utility is meant to be a more lightweight implementation of the same
idea with the code rewritten for the Bash shell.  The fancier features from
`cheat` are not present.  However, the core functionality of creating,
editing, and reading "cheat sheets" is intact.
